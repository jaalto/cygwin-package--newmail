sdesc: "Notificator for incoming mail"
ldesc: "A small utility that stays in the background and helps you keep track
of your incoming mail. It is used to monitor an arbitrary amount of
mailboxes and display the subject when new mail arrives. The program
can be integrated into window-oriented programs, such as tool bars.
This program was inspired by the similar newmail program from the Elm
Mail User Agent."
